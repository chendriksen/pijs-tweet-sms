pijs-tweet-sms
==============

When someone I follow mentions a keyword, send me an SMS of their tweet.

v0.1 Guide:

1. Get your Raspberry Pi set up with pijs (www.pijs.io)
2. Install the dependencies via NPM (twilio and user-stream)
3. Update the code with your credentials.
4. Copy the code from index.js into your pijs code editor.
5. You're done!

TIP: This can also be run as a standard Node.js application!
